# Music Library
## Project Overview:
The Music Library is a Python and SQL-based platform designed for both music creators and listeners to engage with digital music seamlessly. It enables artists to upload tracks, collaborate, track their biggest fans, and monitor playlist trends, while listeners can search, stream, and manage their own playlists. The system is backed by a relational music database, from which SQL queries extract and analyze data across multiple tables. Data is then transformed, filtered, and visualized using Python and SQLite3, allowing for insights into music trends and user interactions. The project also incorporates robust authentication, enabling users and artists to register, log in, and manage their sessions securely.

## Features:
1. Developed a relational music database with three interconnected tables to store and manage songs, artists, playlists, and user interactions.
2. Utilized SQL queries for data extraction, applying filtering and aggregation functions to analyze music trends and user engagement.
3. Integrated Python with SQLite3 to load, transform, and visualize data for insights into listening habits and artist popularity.
4. Implemented user authentication allowing users and artists to register, log in, and securely manage their sessions.
5. Enabled artists to upload songs, collaborate with other artists, track their top three fans, and view their most featured playlists.
6. Designed an interactive search system for users to find songs, playlists, and artists using keyword-based queries.
7. Allowed users to create and manage playlists, add songs, and explore artist details, enhancing music discovery and personalization.
8. Debugged and tested SQL queries and Python code, ensuring seamless data retrieval and application performance.
