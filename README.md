It allows users and artists to log in or register with an ID and password. Artists have the ability to add a new song, collaborate with other artists on songs, view their top three fans (or less if there are not three) and view the top 3 playlist, or less, they are included in. Users after logging in have the ability to start or end a session. When searching for a song or playlist, users can enter for any keyword that will return all songs or playlists that match. From these songs, users can listen to a song, learn more information about a song, or add the song to a playlist. Users can add to their existing playlist, or create new playlists. Users can also search for artists and discover more information about them and their songs. Users can perform the same actions on songs as previously mentioned when searched from the search artist tab.
